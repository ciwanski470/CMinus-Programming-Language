# Bad C Compiler

## Description
This is a C99 Compiler that I am making for educational purposes, learning about compilers and low-level programming.
There is no use case for this compiler over GCC or Clang, as there is no preprocessor or linker (so it can only be used on a single file).
It would also run slower than GCC and Clang and produce less-optimized assembly (obviously).
It is a fun project, though.
